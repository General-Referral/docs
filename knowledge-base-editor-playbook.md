## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** "I can't access the web editor"
**Solution:** Contact your Mintlify admin to ensure you have editor permissions. The web editor requires a Mintlify account with editing rights.

**Problem:** "My article isn't showing in the navigation menu"
**Solution:** The web editor should automatically handle navigation updates. If not, contact your admin or check the navigation settings.

**Problem:** "My formatting looks wrong in Visual Mode"
**Solution:** Switch between Visual and Markdown modes to troubleshoot. The Visual Mode shows exactly how it will appear when published.

**Problem:** "My links don't work"
**Solution:** 
- For internal links: Use the full path like `/knowledge-base/section/article-name`
- For external links: Include `https://` at the beginning

**Problem:** "I can't find the edit button on my live site"
**Solution:** The edit button availability depends on your Mintlify plan and permissions. Contact your admin if you should have access but don't see it.

**Problem:** "My YouTube video won't display"
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the `embed` version of the YouTube URL, not the regular watch URL.

### Getting Help
- **For content questions:** Contact the team member responsible for knowledge base content
- **For technical issues:** Contact your development team or Mintlify support
- **For urgent fixes:** Make a note of the issue and contact both content and technical teams
