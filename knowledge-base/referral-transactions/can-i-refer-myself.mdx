Absolutely\! It's one of the best reasons for keeping your license as a referral agent. If you or your immediate family move just once every ten years, it can more than cover the cost of holding your license as a referral agent. Whether renting, purchasing or selling, you save money by referring yourself.

You get the same great deal as any other referral you complete while licensed with General Referral: 100% commission (less our fixed transaction fee), negotiate the best referral fee you can get and choose any agent you are comfortable with.

In addition to the other benefits of referring yourself, you should keep an eye open for opportunities to use your license to help friends and family move.
