Referral agreements sent with SignWell are automatically emailed to all parties upon completion.

The agreement is sent as a PDF attachment to the email address you provided when you submitted the referral.

If the referral agreement was sent, but you did not receive a fully executed copy, it's likely the agreement was not signed by all parties. It's important that you contact the receiving agent to ensure they received the signature request. If not, the agreement was likely sent to the wrong email address and you will need to recreate and resend the agreement.
