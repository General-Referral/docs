title: "W-9 Form Not Working in Gusto?"
description: "If you’re having trouble completing your W-9 form in Gusto, it may be due to a delayed signup after receiving your invitation. This is a known issue and is usually quick to resolve."
---

<Note>
  If you wait too long to accept your Gusto invitation, the W-9 form can stop working. The solution is simple: **request a new invite and complete the signup right away**.
</Note>

## Why This Happens

When you receive an invitation to sign up for Gusto, the link is **time-sensitive**. If too much time passes before you complete the signup:

- The invitation can partially expire
- The onboarding session may break
- The W-9 form may stop working properly

Even if the link still opens, the system behind it may no longer be valid.

## What You Might See

If this happens, you may experience:

- The W-9 form not loading
- A blank or frozen W-9 page
- An error message when submitting the form
- Being unable to move past the tax form step

## How to Fix It (Fastest Solution)

1. Stop trying to complete the current W-9 form
2. Contact our team and request a **new Gusto invitation**
3. Once you receive the new invite, **complete the signup right away**
4. Fill out the W-9 in the same session without long pauses

In most cases, this immediately fixes the issue.

## How to Avoid This in the Future

- Complete your Gusto signup **as soon as you receive the invitation**
- Avoid opening the link and coming back to it days later
- Use a standard browser like **Chrome or Edge**
- Do not use private/incognito mode when completing the W-9
