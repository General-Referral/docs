1. **Choose a partner agent**. Every agent loves referrals, so finding one to take your customers will be easy. The challenge is [finding a good agent](https://app.generalreferral.com/kb/referral-transactions/who-receives-referral) to take your customers. If you don't know where to start, we're happy to introduce you to high quality agents we know in your local market.
2. **Get the word out**. Someone in your sphere of influence is likely moving this year. Keep your ears open, share advice about choosing an agent on social media, and remember to speak up and offer your services.
3. **Customer intake**. Ask questions and listen, listen, listen. The more you know about your potential customers' goals, timeline, and parameters, the better you will do at matching them with an agent. See the attached sample form to get an idea about the type of information you will eventually need to collect.
4. **Making the introduction**. Once you agree on [a referral fee](https://www.generalreferral.com/blog/referral-fees) with your partner agent (a typical fee is 25%), it's time to [get the agreement in writing](https://docs.generalreferral.com/knowledge-base/referral-transactions/how-to-submit-referral). At this point, you will unmask the customer to your partner agent, and they will be responsible for helping your customer transact.
5. **Checking in**. There won't be much for you to do if your partner agent is doing a good job, but it still makes sense to check-in with your customer & partner agent every few weeks to make sure things are on track.
6. **Closing the deal**. When your deal is closed or a closing date is set, [email the office](https://app.generalreferral.com/contact). If you're not yet signed up with our payroll provider, we'll send you an invite to create a profile that includes your banking info for direct deposit.
7. **Getting paid**. When the commission check is received, we scan it and email it to you. At that point, you simply need to [process your commission disbursement](https://docs.generalreferral.com/knowledge-base/referral-transactions/how-to-get-paid). Once received, your direct deposit typically takes four business days.
