    If you selected "Yes", provide:
    - Receiving agent name and contact info

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Negotiate Your Fee First">
    Always agree on the referral fee percentage with the receiving agent before submitting the agreement. [Learn about typical referral fees](https://www.generalreferral.com/blog/referral-fees).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Follow Up Promptly">
    Check with the receiving agent and manager the next business day to ensure they received the DocuSign request. Quick follow-up prevents delays.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep Records">
    You'll automatically receive a fully executed copy via email once all parties sign. Save this for your records and for commission disbursement.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Up Payroll First Time">
    After your first referral, we'll invite you to create an account with our payroll provider for direct deposit. This streamlines future payments.
  </Accordion>

## Managing Your Referral

### After Submission

Once you submit the referral agreement:

1. **Automatic Distribution** - DocuSign sends to all parties
2. **Track Signatures** - Monitor who has signed
3. **Receive Confirmation** - Get fully executed copy via email
4. **Stay Involved** - Check in periodically on transaction progress

### Need to Make Changes?

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if the agreement doesn't fit my situation?">
    For unique referral structures, [contact our support team](https://app.generalreferral.com/members) for assistance with custom agreements.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does the signing process take?">
    Most agreements are fully executed within 24-48 hours. Follow up if you don't receive confirmation within this timeframe.
  </Accordion>
