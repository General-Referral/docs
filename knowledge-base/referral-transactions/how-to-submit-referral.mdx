    Check with the receiving agent and manager the next business day to ensure they received the SignWell request. Quick follow-up prevents delays.

## Managing Your Referral

### After Submission

Once you submit the referral agreement:

1. **Automatic Distribution** - SignWell sends to all parties after General Referral signs it
2. **Track Signatures** - Monitor who has signed
3. **Receive Confirmation** - Get fully executed copy via email
4. **Stay Involved** - Check in periodically on transaction progress
