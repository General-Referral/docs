The transaction commission is paid to the brokerage you refer the customer to. At closing, the brokerage or settlement company will then disburse the referral commission portion to General Referral.

When General Referral receives the commission, we will email you with confirmation. You can then [process your commission disbursement](https://docs.generalreferral.com/knowledge-base/referral-transactions/how-to-get-paid).

If you have any questions about your referral commission, first, please contact the brokerage you referred the customer to. The key details you need are the date the commission was sent and the location it was sent to. If you are unable to resolve the issue, please [contact us](https://app.generalreferral.com/contact).
