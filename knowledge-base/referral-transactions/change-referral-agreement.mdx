Some referral agreements that have been sent and/or fully executed by Docusign may need to be changed due to an error or a change in the agreement.

To change a fully executed referral agreement, [complete a new referral agreement on our website](https://app.generalreferral.com/kb/referral-transactions/how-to-submit-referral) & include the following in the "Notes" section of the agreement:

> _This agreement shall override and replace the previous agreement, dated [insert date of previous agreement] for the named client(s)._

Insert the date the old agreement was sent in place of the brackets. If the date is not available, remove the bold text.

If the referral agreement was sent, but not fully executed (i.e you never received a fully executed version), please also notify the office to void the old agreement by [emailing us](https://app.generalreferral.com/contact)
