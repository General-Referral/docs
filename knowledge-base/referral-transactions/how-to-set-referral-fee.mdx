title: "How do I set the referral fee?"
---

Setting the right referral fee is crucial for maximizing your earnings while maintaining strong relationships with partner agents. Here's how to determine the appropriate fee for your referrals:

## **Understanding the Market-Based Approach**

<Info>
  **The fee is set by what the market will bear.** This means the referral fee should reflect the value that receiving agents are willing to pay for your qualified leads. The market determines the fee, not arbitrary percentages.
</Info>

> ## **The 25% Rule of Thumb**
>
> **25% is a good rule of thumb** for most residential real estate referrals. This percentage serves as a baseline that indicates:
>
> - **Higher than 25%**: The referral is more valuable to another agent than average
> - **Lower than 25%**: The referral is less valuable to another agent than average

## **Key Factors That Influence Referral Value**

### **1. Deal Size**

The combination of total property price and commission rate significantly impacts referral value:

- Higher-priced properties typically command higher referral fees
- Properties with standard commission rates (5-6%) are more valuable than those with reduced rates
- Luxury properties often justify premium referral fees

### **2. Ease of Transaction**

The amount of labor required from the receiving agent affects value:

- **Sellers are usually easier** than buyers (less time-intensive)
- **Qualified buyers** are easier than non-qualified buyers
- Pre-approved buyers with clear criteria are highly valuable
- Motivated sellers with realistic expectations command higher fees

### **3. Future Transaction Potential**

Our standard agreement provides for all transactions that occur over a negotiated timeframe (default is two years):

- Clients likely to buy/sell multiple properties increase referral value
- Investors or families planning multiple moves are premium referrals
- Long-term relationship potential adds significant value

### **4. Local Market Conditions**

The overall state of the housing market affects referral value:

- **In a buyer's market**: Buyers have more value due to scarcity
- **In a seller's market**: Sellers may command higher fees
- Market volatility can impact perceived value
- Seasonal factors may influence fee negotiations

## **Negotiating Your Referral Fee**

### **Shop Around for the Best Deal**

**A good referral is a golden opportunity for a full-service agent.** Don't be afraid to shop your referral around to multiple agents. You are removing the uncertainty of their marketing costs, which has enormous value. Full-service agents spend significant time and money on lead generation, so a qualified referral is highly valuable to them.

### **Don't Automatically Accept the Highest Offer**

<Note>
  **Ensure the agent is competent, professional, ethical, and experienced** in the type of deal your referral is seeking. The highest fee doesn't always mean the best service for your client.
</Note>

> Consider the following:
>
> - Agent's track record with similar properties
> - Their communication style and responsiveness
> - Professional reputation and ethics
> - Experience in the specific market or property type
> - Client satisfaction history

## **Best Practices for Fee Negotiation**

1. **Research local market rates** for similar referrals
2. **Present your referral professionally** with complete information
3. **Highlight the referral's value** (qualified buyer, motivated seller, etc.)
4. **Negotiate based on value**, not just percentage
5. **Consider the long-term relationship** potential
6. **Document all agreements** clearly in writing

## **When to Adjust Your Fee Expectations**

> ### **Consider Lowering Your Fee When:**
>
> - The client needs extensive hand-holding or education
> - The property type is outside the agent's expertise
> - Market conditions are challenging
> - The client has unrealistic expectations

> ### **Consider Increasing Your Fee When:**
>
> - The client is highly qualified and motivated
> - The property is in a premium market segment
> - The agent will receive significant future business
> - The transaction is straightforward and low-risk

<Note>
  Remember: Your referral fee should reflect the true value you're providing to the receiving agent while ensuring your client receives excellent service. Focus on building long-term relationships with quality agents who will consistently provide great service to your referrals.
