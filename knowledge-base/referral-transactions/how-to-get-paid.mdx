## How Commission Is Collected

Upon closing, the receiving agent or their brokerage will instruct the settlement company to send the commission payment directly to General Referral, LLC, as per NJ licensing law.

<Info>
  **Important:** All commissions are issued to the brokerage (General Referral), which then disburses funds to agents. This is required by New Jersey regulations.
</Info>

### Your Responsibility
