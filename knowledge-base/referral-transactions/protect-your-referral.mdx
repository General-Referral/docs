title: "How to Protect Your Referral From Being Taken"
description: "If you’re concerned that a receiving agent may try to work directly with your client without paying a referral fee, there are a few simple steps you can take to protect yourself."

### Recommended Best Practice

**Send a confirmation email before submitting the formal referral agreement.**\
In that email, clearly outline:

- The agreed-upon **referral fee**
- A **general description of the client** (no sensitive details needed)
- Confirmation that they agree to those terms

Getting written agreement by email provides strong protection before the formal referral is sent.

### Secondary Option

If email confirmation isn’t possible, a **verbal approval** from the receiving agent or broker is the next best option.

### Why This Matters

Most Realtor boards enforce a **code of ethics** that prohibits agents from stealing referrals. If a receiving agent violates this, they could face disciplinary action—including **loss of their license**.

Having written or verbal confirmation helps protect you and strengthens your position if an issue ever arises.
