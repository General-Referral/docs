## **To Cancel your Plan**

Simply log into [the member portal](https://app.generalreferral.com/members) and select cancel my plan. Unfortunately, we are not able to process refunds. Upon cancellation, you will receive an automatic confirmation from our system.

Memberships may be automatically cancelled, without notice, for failure to pay membership renewal or for failure to complete any steps required for license renewal.

## **To Release Your License**

Once your plan has been cancelled, you will need to [send an email](https://app.generalreferral.com/contact) requesting that we release your license. Within ten business days (usually much faster), your license will be released to the State of New Jersey and will appear as inactive until you join a broker. We will send you a notification once this step is complete.

Confirmation of your license status can be obtained using the state's license lookup portal: https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/division_rec/licensing/online_Instructions/licSearch.html

Once your license has been released, it usually takes 24 hours before the state portal is updated.

## **Commission Distribution After Cancellation**

Per the terms of your [independent contractor agreement](https://www.generalreferral.com/ica), upon cancellation of your membership or termination of your license affiliation with General Referral, you will be compensated as follows:

<Warning>
**Post-Termination Commission Split**
- Associates are entitled to **50% of the gross commission** received by GR on the **first completed transaction** for each fully executed referral agreement that was in place before termination
- Associates receive **0% commission on any subsequent transactions** from those same referrals


**Important Notes**
- This 50% is calculated after deducting any applicable expenses, fees, and co-brokerage commissions
- The commission rate that applies is the one in effect when the referral was initially submitted and approved by GR (or when first contact was made with the prospective customer, whichever came first)
- GR is not liable for any commissions that cannot be collected
- Commission disbursement still requires completion of all standard requirements (referral form, transaction closing confirmation, disbursement form, and available funds)

This structure ensures agents receive compensation for referrals they initiated while active, even after choosing to cancel their agreement, though ongoing benefits from those relationships remain with GR.
