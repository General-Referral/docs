title: "How do I cancel my plan with General Referral?"

## **To Cancel your Plan**

Simply log into [the member portal](https://app.generalreferral.com/members) and select cancel my plan. Unfortunately, we are not able to process refunds. Upon cancellation, you will receive an automatic confirmation from our system.

Memberships will be automatically cancelled for failure to pay membership renewal or for failure to complete any steps required for license renewal.

## **To Release Your License**

Once your plan has been cancelled, you will need to [send an email](https://app.generalreferral.com/contact) requesting that we release your license. Within ten business days (usually much faster), your license will be released to the State of New Jersey and will appear as inactive until you join a broker. We will send you a notification once this step is complete.

Confirmation of your license status can be obtained using the state's license lookup portal: https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/division_rec/licensing/online_Instructions/licSearch.html

Once your license has been released, it usually takes 24 hours before the state portal is updated.

## **Referral Agreements**

Per the terms of your [independent contractor agreement](https://www.generalreferral.com/ica), upon cancellation of your membership or termination of your license affiliation with General Referral, you will be compensated as follows:

For commission received amounts over \$590, you receive 50% of the commission received by General Referral on the initial transaction related to any existing referral agreements. Any subsequent transactions subject to the referral agreement or for any referral commission collected less than \$590, you will not be compensated.
