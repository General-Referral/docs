You may have received an email or SMS reminder about amounts that you owe to General Referral. We automatically charge your payment method on file on the due date. Once, payment has succeeded, you will receive an email with a "PAID" invoice attached. If there is an issue with your payment, you will also be notified by email.

If you would like to see or update the payment method you have on file, please follow these instructions: [update your payment method](https://docs.generalreferral.com/knowledge-base/membership-management/update-payment-method)
