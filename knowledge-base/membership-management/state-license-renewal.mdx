## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I miss the May 15th deadline?">
    You can still complete the questionnaire, but you'll incur a $40 late fee. The final deadline is June 30th.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do referral agents need continuing education?">
    No! New Jersey waives CE requirements for referral agents. This saves you time and money compared to full-service agents.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if my payment method fails?">
    Update your payment information immediately through the [member portal](/knowledge-base/membership-management/update-payment-method). Contact support if you need assistance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I renew my license independently?">
    No, as your sponsoring broker, General Referral must handle the renewal process on your behalf. This is required by NJ regulations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens if I don't renew on time?">
    Your license becomes inactive and you cannot engage in real estate activities. Reactivation may require additional fees and processes.
