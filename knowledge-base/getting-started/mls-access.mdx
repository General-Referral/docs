Not directly, but you also avoid the costs, which can run north of \$2,000 per year. That said, we know how useful the MLS can be, so if online portals, such as Zillow & RedFin, don't meet your needs, we suggest exploring how a partnership with a full-time agent can put your referral business in overdrive & provide you with indirect access to the MLS.

Full service agents stand to gain a valuable new source of business from building relationships with referral agents. It's likely that a full service agent you send referrals to will gladly setup a report that will automatically notify you of properties matching your search criteria.
