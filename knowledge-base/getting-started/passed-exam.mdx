Once you've completed your pre-licensure coursework, New Jersey requires that you pass the state licensing exam and find a broker sponsor within one year of your class completion. GR can be your sponsor, even with a tight deadline.

  Additional steps you will need to take include sending the following to GR after you've signed up:

  1. Provide copy of U.S. government issued photo ID (state or federal)
  2. Copy of your exam pass notice
</Check>

After sign up, ensure your [fingerprints](https://www.state.nj.us/dobi/division_rec/licensing/fingerprint.html) are complete. General Referral does not need confirmation of your fingerprint status. Questions on fingerprints and any other licensing questions should be directed to the state of New Jersey:
