> When you initially complete the GR signup process, we immediately make a non-refundable charge to your payment method for all Plan and State fees calculated. If, for any reason, you are unable to forward any documents required for transferring your license, including terminating your license with your prior broker, this will not impact your member anniversary date.

> ### **State Fees**
>
> Upon signup, we calculate your state fees based on the information you provide. Initial fees often include a license transfer fee payable to the state by General Referral.
>
> Based on your circumstances, you may also see fees for license type change, license reactivation or license renewal. Consistent with regulations, real estate agents are typically charged a license renewal fee of a set amount on a regular basis.
>
> We pay the state on your behalf once the fees are collected. You may incur a small processing fee for the state fees to cover the cost of the transaction.
