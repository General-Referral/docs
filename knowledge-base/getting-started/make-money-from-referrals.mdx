# Three steps guaranteed to help you earn income from referrals:

1. **Tell people what you do**
   - Reach out to your sphere of influence. Tell family, friends and any other groups you have an affiliation with.
   - Ask if they are considering moving in the next year.
   - If so, ask if you can reach out to them to share some ways you can make the process easier.
   - If so, ask who they would contact first if they are considering moving.
   - Ask those people if they would be willing to reach out to you as a first step.
   - If not, ask those people if they would be more willing to reach out to you as a first step if they would receive a no obligation rebate of \$500... then steadily increase that number until they are excited.
   - If they don't push back on your proposal, be sure to object on their behalf... what if your wife says no? etc.
2. **Remind people what you do**
   - Regularly ask the people from step one if they are considering moving in the next year.
3. **Help people do what they need to do**
   - Offer to guide them through the process. Use the General Referral checklist to help them prioritize the steps they can take to improve the odds of a successful outcome.
   - Introduce them to realtors well suited to handling their unique situation.
