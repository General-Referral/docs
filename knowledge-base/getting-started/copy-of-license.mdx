From the [State of New Jersey website](https://www.nj.gov/dobi/division_rec/licensing/online_Instructions/pocketlicense.html):

> The real estate license for individuals and the real estate pocket card have been combined. The license now also serves as the pocket card. These new individual licenses have been reduced in size (4.36" x 2.73") to accomodate display on a digital device. If you decide to print your license, it may be printed on paper of any color or quality yet must be legible.
