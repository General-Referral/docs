<Info>
  A handful of states, like New Jersey, do have a special license type classification for referral agents.
</Info>

In New Jersey, there were recent changes in the law which created two new license types and eliminated one. The "Referral Agent" license was replaced with "Salesperson (Referral)", and there is now a second license type that can be held at the brokerage level in addition to "Real Estate Company", called "Real Estate Referral Company". As General Referral is licensed in New Jersey under the new company classification, all New Jersey licensees under General Referral are classified as "Salesperson (Referral)", consistent with the law.
