<Info>
  A handful of states, like New Jersey, do have a special license type classification for referral agents.
</Info>

If you're not already licensed at a referral company, we will handle transitioning your license to referral status. The state charges \$50 to change your license type, which will be calculated in the checkout. You can see the exact amount you will owe by starting the checkout [here](https://app.generalreferral.com/join). 

For background, in New Jersey, recent changes in 2019 updated the law to create a second type of real estate brokerage, called "Real Estate Referral Company". As General Referral is licensed in New Jersey under the new company classification, all New Jersey licensees under General Referral are classified as "Salesperson (Referral)", consistent with the law.
