## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost to join?">
    We offer flexible plans starting at competitive rates. Visit our [Plans page](https://www.generalreferral.com/plans) for current pricing. You'll see the exact amount due during step 4 of the signup process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need continuing education?">
    No! New Jersey waives continuing education requirements for referral agents. However, if you switch to full-service, you'll need to complete any missed CE.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I get MLS access?">
    Not directly, but you'll also avoid the $2,000+ annual cost. Partner with full-service agents who can provide you with market insights and property information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are the requirements after passing my exam?">
    You'll need to: (1) Provide a copy of your government-issued ID, (2) Submit your exam pass notice, (3) Complete fingerprinting, and (4) Find a sponsoring broker (that's us!).
