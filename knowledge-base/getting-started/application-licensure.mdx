An automatic email confirmation will be sent to the Broker of Record and the candidate once approval is granted. You can also check the [Licensee Search](https://www-dobi.state.nj.us/DOBI_LicSearch/) feature on the DOBI website.

The candidate will be in a "Pending" status until all information submitted is reviewed and fingerprint results are cleared. Once everything is cleared, the Real Estate Commission (REC) staff will be able to approve the candidate for licensure.
