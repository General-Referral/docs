title: Requirements After Passing Your Exam
description: What new licensees need to do after passing the real estate exam
---

General Referral is a great option for new agents looking for an introduction to the business and a low-cost alternative to hanging their license at a full-service broker.

<Info>
  **Time Sensitive:** After completing your pre-licensure coursework, New Jersey requires that you pass the state licensing exam and find a broker sponsor within one year of your class completion.
