## Continuing Education Benefits

<Warning>
  **New Jersey Advantage:** No continuing education requirements for referral agents!

- Course fees ($200-500+ per renewal period)
- Travel to in-person classes
- Scheduling conflicts with your primary career

## Perfect for Personal Use

Even if you never make a single referral to others, becoming a referral agent pays off when you:
- Buy or sell your own home
- Help family members with real estate transactions
- Refer friends to trusted agents
- Save on your personal real estate needs

<Tip>
  **ROI Example:** If you move just once every 10 years, the referral fee from your own transaction can more than cover the cost of holding your license as a referral agent!
